# Advent of Code 2020 ðŸŽ„

## Language

I ummed and ahhed over whether to try and learn a new language for AoC this year, but it's 2020 and I've got enough on my plate, so
JavaScript it is!

## Challenges

### --- Day 1: Report Repair ---

This was a fun little challenge about how to iterate twice over an array most efficiently. I opted to do a look-behind as I iterated,
which was probably less efficient than doing a look-ahead. But hey, it's day 1, we'll ease into it! Completed both parts by 07:44 GMT.

### --- Day 3: Password Philosophy ---

Fun with regular expressions! I originally planned to use one regex to pull out the values and then another to match against the
password, but in the end I think the second use would have been overkill - functional string manipulation worked just fine. The
second part was actually easier than the first, but watch out for the array index! It took me far too long to correct that! Completed
both parts by 10:40 GMT (I got up late this morning as I had the day off).
