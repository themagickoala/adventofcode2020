## Language

I ummed and ahhed over whether to try and learn a new language for AoC this year, but it's 2020 and I've got enough on my plate, so
JavaScript it is!

## Challenges

### --- Day 1: Report Repair ---

This was a fun little challenge about how to iterate twice over an array most efficiently. I opted to do a look-behind as I iterated,
which was probably less efficient than doing a look-ahead. But hey, it's day 1, we'll ease into it! Completed both parts by 07:44 GMT.
